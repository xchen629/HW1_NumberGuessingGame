# MobileApp_NumberGuessingGame
This application is a number guess game, users will be entering a number to the input box.  
When user click the enter button, the app will check whether the number use entered matches the number that is randomly created.  
There are also three more button on the bottom of the input box.  play Again? give up? and let me out?  play Again button act like a refresh 
button, which means it will clear out all score history and hints inorder to start the next guess.  Give up button will show
 you the number that is randomly assigned when clicked.  let me out button is like a shut down button for the app, if clicked the 
app will be closed and exit to the phone screen.  I used the exitProcess(1) in the code that I found online, in order for me kill the process of the app.
